# MyPortfolio -- [https://majdbarakat.dev/](https://majdbarakat.github.io/MyPortfolio/)

**ABOUT**

This is my first ever website, I started this project as an introduction to web development.
Using JavaScript, JQuery, Plain CSS has been a great challenge and taught me so much about manipulating DOM and making it pretty all at once.

My next project will be a dive into frameworks and pre-processors, such as React.js and Sass.
With the addition of some libraries to improve UI/UX specifically, Three.js and GSAP.
